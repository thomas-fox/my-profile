					<p>Thanks to an opportunity to approach the equestrian world, I did two internships with a racehorse trainer. I really enjoyed these experiences as I saw a side of the working world where passion and the desire to succeed are paramount; they made me aware of the work that needs to be done to reach the professional level and also of the importance of behaviour and decision making when occupying a position of responsibility where it is necessary to manage external relations, personnel and define the strategy of the races.
					I also did an internship in a bakery. The aim was to discover an artisanal company. I really enjoyed this experience where there was a family atmosphere and mutual support.
					Finally, I did an internship at IntermarchÃ© with the aim of getting to know the world of mass distribution. 
					These internships allowed me to observe different work environments, with one focused on sports, one on a craft company and the last on a company of the large distribution.
