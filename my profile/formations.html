				<p> In June 2021, I passed my baccalaureate with honours, specialising in mathematics and physics-chemistry, which I followed at the Groupe-Scolaire Sophie-Barat.
				Then, in parallel to my general high school, I followed a double-course for three years, allowing me to obtain the baccalaureate and the American High School Diploma for which I obtained each year a certificate of honour attributed to students with a score of at least 90%. This American curriculum allowed me to discover new subjects such as economics, American history and psychology. 
				Finally, I am currently enrolled in the Grande Ecole programme at the I√âSEG School of Management, where I am expecting to graduate in 2026.
