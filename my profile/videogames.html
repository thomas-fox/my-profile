				<p>Since as long as I can remember, I have always been playing video games. 
				Whether it's on WII, DS or PS4, I grew up playing video games. Nowadays, I love to play with my friends during my free time.
				I also like to watch Esport competitions, as it is getting more and more recognised.   </p>
