				<h1>SPORTS ⚽</h1>
				<img src="images/england.gif" border="8px">
				<p> I have always loved sports in general, and especially football.
					I have been playing football for 14 years and I also played tennis competitively for 6 years.
					To come back to football, I am currently playing in the regional team of US Palaiseau. We had the opportunity to play against several professional clubs such as PSG or the French women's team. My team was also invited to the Elysée Palace which we visited during the return of the French team after the 2018 World Cup. 
					I as well played tennis for 7 years. However, I had to make a choice between football and tennis when school courses required more personal work and I continued with football as I prefer team sports.
					Being English, my favourite team is obviously England, and my favourite club is Liverpool with their magical trio Salah, Mané, Firmino.
