				<p>Since I was a kid I have always been fascinated by space and all the questions it brings, such as "how can it expand if it is infinite", or "what was there before Big Bang".
				My favourite films have always been space-related, such as the film Appollo 13, which reflects the "failed successfully" mission, or the film "First Man" which tells the story of Neil Armstrong. 
				As well as films, I really like books about our universe, and in particular Stephen Hawking's two books that I highly recommend: "A Brief History of Time" and "Brief Answers to the Big Questions".
				Finally, here is a small anecdote. During a visit to Cape Canaveral, the rocket launch base in the United States, I was lucky enough to see a rocket take off towards the ISS, then return. It is still one of the best memory of my life.
